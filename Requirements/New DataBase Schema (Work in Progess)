Illustration and Explanation:

1. **User Creation**: Four users are created, two instructors (Anna and John) and two students (Alex and Emma). Each user has a unique role that determines their interaction with the course material.

2. **Course Enrollment**: Both students enroll in both available courses, establishing a relationship between users and courses they are interested in or required to take.

3. **Assignment Creation and Submission**: The instructors create assignments for their courses, which are then submitted to by the students. This illustrates how coursework is distributed, completed, and tracked within the system.

4. **Discussions and Engagement**: Anna initiates a discussion related to her course, prompting students to engage with each other and the instructor. This fosters a sense of community and provides a platform for sharing ideas and interests.
